export const PLAYER_PROMPT = `I am playing a guessing game where I will guess a famous personality and you have to guess the name by asking Yes/No questions.\n
These are the rules to follow before asking the questions.\n
1. You cannot ask the direct name of the person.\n

4. If you guessed the name, write the name.\n
5. Do not repeat the same question. Look at the questions and answers list.\n
